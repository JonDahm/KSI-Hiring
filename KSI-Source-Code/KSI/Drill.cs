        // Part one - Animation for drill including change of collision mesh.
        // Part two - Resource cost / build cost / research cost - Ideally three levels of drills with one pretty early and building up.
        // Drill should have three parts - One - what ore it is drilling (a cycle through ore types that are valid at the time in game)
        // Stage one we need to make a simple drill that works - we need to use our own DLL so that we can build the cycle system into it.
        // Ideally this is a precursor to the drill platform we may design
