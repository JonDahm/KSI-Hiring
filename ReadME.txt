This is provided as is.
It is BETA at best.

It over-writes part of the Astronaut Complex with a new hiring platform.

Be aware that it uses code to create new kerbals and you may find some glitches.

In addition be aware that at the moment the kerbals look all the same, with gender changes but still the same.

This mod will be updated. Again WiP use at your own risk!!!

Although I have tested it as best as I can I can not confirm it in all the various situations.

You should always save your game before installing new mods.

In theory this mod should be removable without any issue to your saved game after it is removed but I can not confirm this 100%.

I hope people find this mod useful.

Things planned to be added:

1. Different descriptors for kerbals so they look different.
2. A hiring cost penalty based on the number of 'dead' kerbals you have in each profession.
3. The ability to limit the level of hire based on avaliable kerbals in the KSC of that level minus 1 (Right now it is limited by the level of the complex only).
